# The behavior of this overlay is also part of the basic overlay, but it exists in separation because we may need
# to apply it repeatedly, every time we want to allow access to an external user. The procedure consists in
# placing the user's public key in /nfs/environment/authorized-keys and running the overlay on the instances
# we want to give the user access to:

# em overlay --overlay authorized-keys <instance-name> ...
